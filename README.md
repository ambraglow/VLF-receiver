# E202 VLF receiver
This is my own spin on the E202 VLF receiver design, as a PCB.
It features 2.1mm mounting holes, a line-out audio transformer (so it can be directly connected to a soundcard) and a volume control slider.

## June update
Today on June 16th i received a batch of boards, thanks to PCBWay for sponsoring this project!  
Here's some pictures of the boards, they really look stunning in yellow silkscreen (it was a [suggestion](https://github.com/luxploit) by my gf :3).

Functionally they should work, but that will be a problem for future me :D
